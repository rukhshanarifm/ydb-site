# Intro
YDB!! HEELLO
# Background
Born and raised in Lahore, I earned my undergraduate degree from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) before moving to the United States for graduate studies at the University of Chicago. From 2019 to 2024, I lived and worked in Chicago and New York, gaining extensive experience in helping organizations build and scale their data infrastructure.

In 2024, I returned to Lahore and am now looking to collaborate with organizations eager to leverage data for meaningful impact.
